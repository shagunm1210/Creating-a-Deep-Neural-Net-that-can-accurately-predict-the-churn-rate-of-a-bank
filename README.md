# Creating-a-Deep-Neural-Net-that-can-accurately-predict-the-churn-rate-of-a-bank
Using stochastic gradient descent I programmed a deep neural network to accurately predict the churn rate of a bank as well as being able to identify the top 10% of customers that have the highest probability of leaving the bank.
